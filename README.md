# Dotfiles

## Install

```
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
make install
```

## Local Fish Config

If there's customization you want Fish to load on startup that is specific to
this machine (stuff you don't want to commit into the repo), after running `./bin/install.sh`, open `~/.env.fish`
and put it all in there. It will be loaded at the top of `fish/config.fish`.

## MacOS Defaults

If you're on MacOS and want some sensible defaults, you can run `./bin/macos_defaults.sh`.
